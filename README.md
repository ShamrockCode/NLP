# EE6041: Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing Assignment

## Overview

This assignment is part of the EE6041 course, focusing on various techniques and methods in Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The aim is to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems, enhancing our understanding of text processing and analysis. The following key areas are covered:

- Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Word Tokenization
- Text Normalization and Stemming
- Minimum Edit Distance
- Phonetic Matching
- N-grams
- Spelling Correction
- Text Classification in NLP
- Spam Filtering and Sentiment Analysis
- Evaluating the Performance of Text Classification Systems

## Objectives

1. **Understand and apply Regular Expressions (Regex)** for pattern matching and text extraction.
2. Perform **Word Tokenization** to split text into meaningful units.
3. Explore **Text Normalization and Stemming** techniques to reduce words to their base forms.
4. Implement the **Minimum Edit Distance** algorithm to find the similarity between text strings.
5. Utilize **Phonetic Matching** to find words that sound similar.
6. Generate **N-grams** to understand the context and sequence of words.
7. Develop algorithms for **Spelling Correction** to automatically correct text.
8. Apply NLP techniques for **Text Classification**, focusing on spam filtering and sentiment analysis.
9. **Evaluate the Performance** of text classification systems using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technologies and Libraries

This project utilizes Python as the primary programming language, leveraging libraries such as NLTK, scikit-learn, and pandas for text processing and machine learning tasks.

## Setup and Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install required Python libraries using `pip`:

4. Run the scripts as instructed in each section's README to perform specific NLP tasks.
